## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1:  
REST APIs are scalable because they optimize client-server interactions.

Answer for Question 2:  
The resouces the mail is server is providing to clients are a mail ID, a receiver, a subject, and a message for the body. 

Answer for Question 3:  
One common REST method not used in the mail server is PUT. We could extend this to mail by creating an update_mail function to update the contents of some mail, given the ID. 

Answer for Question 4:  
API keys are used because they provide identification for the application thatâ€™s making the API call and checks if the application has the authorization to make the API call. This the ESP to reject calls from applications without proper authorization.
